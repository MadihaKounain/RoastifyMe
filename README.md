RoastifyMe is a fun AI-powered Python application that analyzes user input and generates witty roasts or positive compliments.
The project combines rule-based intelligence with creative text generation to deliver humorous, engaging, and interactive responses.

Designed as a lightweight AI-style application, RoastifyMe demonstrates how structured data, text processing, and modular Python architecture can be used to build entertaining intelligent systems.

🚀 Features

🤖 AI-style roast generation

💬 Compliment generation mode

🧠 Modular text generation engines

🔊 Voice output support

📂 Organized roast & compliment banks

📝 Logging system for generated responses

⚡ Lightweight and easy to run locally

🧠 How It Works

RoastifyMe uses predefined response banks combined with a generation engine to produce context-based outputs.

Workflow:

User runs the application.

Input is processed by the engine.

System selects or constructs a roast/compliment.

Response is displayed (and optionally played as audio).

Output is logged for tracking.
